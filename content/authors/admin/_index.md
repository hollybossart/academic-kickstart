I'm a second year joint PhD student in the department of Statistics and Data Science, and the Heinz Public Policy school. I'm currently working with Dr. Zachary Branson and Dr. Edward H. Kennedy on a project using nonparametric causal inference tools to study incarceration's impact on depressive symptoms. At Boise State University, I received a HERC fellowship to work under Dr. Jaechoul Lee in the Department of Mathematics on equivalent sample size calibration for long memory time series data.
